* Ayo, Iâ€™m @rifersouli, from Brazil.
* I'm just a student going through Computing Science, learning what I can.
* Sincerely, right now I'm focusing on my survival through graduation, though I do have some projects you may (hopefully) find in my profile, probably also related to the course.
* This certainly isn't a professional GitHub profile, but my intention is not for it to be. I might just leave projects and stuff around here, until I actually become a professional
* So, thank you for reading my profile! I didn't even know anyone would read this, I mean...
