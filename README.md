* Hello, Iâ€™m Ricardo Fernandes Souza Lima, from Brazil.
* I'm a student going through Computing Science.
* Sincerely, right now I'm focusing on my survival through graduation, though I do have some projects you may (hopefully) find in my profile, probably also related to the course.
* This certainly isn't a fully professional GitHub profile, but my intention is for it to be turned into one with time.
* I'm leaving my projects in here, keeping it organized and only keeping relevant stuff.
* Thank you for reading my profile! Feel free to contact me at anytime through my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rifersouli)!
* You can also email me if you wish: rfsouzalima@gmail.com
