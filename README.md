- Ayo, I’m @rifersouli, from Brazil.
- I'm just a student going through Computing Science, learning what I can.
- Sincerely, right now I'm focusing on surviving the semester until it ends ><, though I do have some projects you may (hopefully) find in my profile.
- This certainly isn't a professional GitHub profile, but my intention is not for it to be. I might just leave projects and stuff around here, until I actually become a professional
- So, thank you for reading my profile! I didn't even know anyone would read this, I mean...
